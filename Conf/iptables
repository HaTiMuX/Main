--list -L [chain [rulenum]] 	List the rules in a chain or all chains(FORWARD, INPUT, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING, PREROUTING)
--table	-t table	    	Table to manipulate (default: `filter', nat....)
--append  -A chain	   	Append to chain
--in-interface -i inputname	Network interface name
--out-interface -o outputname	Network interface name
--jump	-j target		Target for rule (MASQUERADE)



nat table:
                  This table is consulted when a packet that creates a new connection is encountered.  It  consists  of
                  three  built-ins:  PREROUTING  (for  altering  packets as soon as they come in), OUTPUT (for altering
                  locally-generated packets before routing), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to
                  go out).


connmark
       This module matches the netfilter mark field associated with a connection (which can be set using the CONNMARK target below).
       [!] --mark value[/mask]
       Matches packets in connections with the given mark value (if a mask is specified, this is logically ANDed
       with the mark before the comparison).


conntrack
       This module, when combined with connection tracking, allows access to the connection  tracking  state  for  this
       packet/connection.
       [!] --ctstate statelist
              statelist is a comma separated list of the connection states to match.
